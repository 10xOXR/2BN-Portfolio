## UX

 - TBD 

### User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to _____________:

- TBD

### Design

The design of the site is based on standard Materialize elements...

#### Framework

Frameworks used in the project are:

 - [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)
    - Using the Materialize framework allowed for the development of a clean and modern user interface with minimal need to override or alter the default settings in most cases.
- [jQuery 3.4.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)
    - Although mostly unbound from jQuery in version 1.0.0, Materialize still requires some jQuery in order to properly initialize its elements (such as dropdowns, carousels, etc.).

#### Color Scheme

Given the mythical nature of unicorns, and their representation in popular culture, the site features a bright color scheme with heavy emphasis on pinks and purples. A balance has been struck so that the site doesn't appear garish or off-putting to users.

#### Typography

The primary fonts used on the site are those provided by the Materialize framework. The Google font [Baloo Tamma](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Tamma) has been used for titles and main headings.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create all of the wireframes during the design phase of this site.

These can be found using [this link]().

## Technologies Used

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Open source IDE from Microsoft that was used to code this project.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Remote repository for all project code with git version control.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Compresses images used on the site to keep file sizes to a minimum.

### Front-End Technologies

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) - The fundamental code structure for all webpages.
- [Sass CSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language used to build the CSS for this project and the recommended method to alter the default CSS of the Materialize framework.
- [jQuery 3.4.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/) - Javascript framework used to implement custom code and initialize Materialize functions.
- [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/) - Primary visual framework for this project, based on Google's Material Design.

## Testing

Testing for this project has been completed using manual methods.

### Manual Testing

Extensive manual testing has been completed to check that the site performs as it should in different environments and in different browsers.

An MS Excel workbook detailing these tests can be found [here]().

### Validators

**HTML**

Passing the HTML from all templates and base into the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and no errors have been found.

**CSS**

The CSS for the project has been generated by the Sass CSS extension language. Passing the generated CSS through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) shows that there are no errors. A number of warnings are flagged, but these relate to MS-Grid vendor prefixes and can be safely ignored.

**Javascript**

All Javascript was passed through the [Esprima Syntax Validator](http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) and was found to be syntactically valid.

### Compatibility

The project was tested to ensure full usability across the following browsers and their mobile equivalents (where applicable):

- Chrome *v.75*
- Edge *v.44.18*
- Edge (Chromium) *v.77*
- Firefox *v.67*
- Safari *v.12*
